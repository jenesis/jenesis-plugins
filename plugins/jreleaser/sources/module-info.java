/**
 * Jenesis JReleaser plugin
 *
 * Releases what the build staged with JReleaser, loaded by a class loader of its own and run in the build's JVM rather
 * than as a command, in the project's root and with the version, the metadata and the staged folders the build
 * resolved, resolving JReleaser from the repositories of the build that loads the plugin.
 *
 * @jenesis.release 25
 * @jenesis.pin build.jenesis 0.16.0 SHA-256/0a293bd0f8fe09fac0f19d7f13950b4db3799c5c9a3a6ffa78999b22431d265a
