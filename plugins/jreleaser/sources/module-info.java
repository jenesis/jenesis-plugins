/**
 * Jenesis JReleaser plugin
 *
 * Releases what the build staged with JReleaser, loaded by a class loader of its own and run in the build's JVM rather
 * than as a command, in the project's root and with the version, the metadata and the staged folders the build
 * resolved, resolving JReleaser from the repositories of the build that loads the plugin.
 *
 * @jenesis.release 25
 * @jenesis.pin build.jenesis 0.16.0 SHA-256/937daedf21aebd722a4805a67494d4069daeeb711eb3f20e3fa55499dda60bf5
