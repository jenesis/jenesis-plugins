/**
 * Jenesis ktlint plugin
 *
 * Checks and formats the Kotlin sources of a module with ktlint, as its .editorconfig says. The provider named
 * check reports what is not formatted and the one named format rewrites or verifies it; both resolve ktlint from
 * the repositories of the build that loads the plugin and run it in a JVM of its own.
